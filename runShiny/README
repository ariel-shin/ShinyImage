INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN SHINY APP: 
> setwd('runShiny')
> source('runShiny.R')

#browser should pop up!

Folder contains:
  Old Imagehistory.R that runs but doesn't have all the features as the one currently on github
  app15a.R -- shiny app that integrates shinyimg object
  runShiny.R -- runs the app 

Some details about the Shiny app: 
  -There are three plots. From top down, the first plot is what I was working originally on to create the shiny app. The second plot uses the shinyimg object. TThe third plot works with the first plot and it shows a preview of the crop of the first plot. 
  -A user can hover over the first plot and highlight a portion to preview a crop. Then, they can press keep to make the cropped image their main image to edit. Currently, this is not synced with plot2. 
  -A user can use a sample, upload image, or upload link. This is in sync with both plot1 and plot2. 
  -A user can also upload an image log, which must have the extension .si. This only works with the shinyimg object. It does not work with the sliders very well right now. 
  -A user can increase/decrease brightness and contrast and it will synch with plot1 and plot2. Gamma correction only works for plot1. 
  -Undo and redo only work for plot2 because they work with the shinyimg. 
  -RESET works with plot1 and plot2. 
  - Download Image works with plot1
  - Download Image log works with plot2. 
  - A user can view the Image Log of a .si file.
